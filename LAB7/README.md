LAB-7:QUESTION:

Given the famous iris dataset, find the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.

Once the overall summary statistics have been calculated, identify the summary statistics for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].

Present your results in the appropriate format and write the results in a file.

Discription:

1.The following code first defines the necessary variables and arrays for the program.
2.Reading the data from the CSV file using a BufferedReader and store it in a 2D String array.
3.Parse the data from the 2D array into several Double arrays based on their respective column in the CSV file.
4.Create separate Double arrays for each flower type for each of the four attributes (Sepal Length/Width, Petal Length/Width).
5.Implement five functions to calculate the mean, median, maximum, minimum, and mode of a given array of Double values.
6.Use these functions to calculate the descriptive statistics for each attribute of the entire dataset and for each flower type separately.
7.Write the calculated values to a new txt file using a FileWriter.
