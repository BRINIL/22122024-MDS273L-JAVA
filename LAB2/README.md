LAB-2:Question:

You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
Enter a name
Search for a name
Remove a name

Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!

Discription:

1. This is a Java program that implements a simple name management system. 
2. It allows the user to enter names, search for a name, and remove a name. 
3. The program uses a menu to prompt the user to select an option and then performs the corresponding action. 
4. The names are stored in an array and a count variable is used to keep track of the number of names stored. 
5. The program checks if a name already exists before adding it to the array and also checks if a name exists before attempting to remove it. 
6. The program continues to run until the user selects the exit option.
